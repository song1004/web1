 <h2>CSS</h2>
 <P><strong>CSS</strong> is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
   including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility,
   provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
   enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate.
   css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
   Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same
   markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen,
   in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
   tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed
   on a mobile device.
