 <h2>JavaScript</h2>
 <P><strong>JavaScript</strong> ,often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to
    the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled,
    and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
    object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, <u>JavaScript
    is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web</u>.JavaScript enables interactive
    web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites
    use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated
    JavaScript engine to execute it. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports
    event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
    programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
    standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language 
    itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
    facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.
