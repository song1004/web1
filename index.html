 <h2>WEB</h2>
 <p>
   The World Wide<strong> <u>Web</u></strong> (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system
  where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource
  Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by
  hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the
  Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed
  by users by a software application called a web browser and are published by a
  software application called a web server. English engineer and computer
  scientist Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.
  He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva,
  Switzerland.[3][4] The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other
  research institutions starting in January 1991 and then to the general public in
  August 1991. The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the
  Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.
